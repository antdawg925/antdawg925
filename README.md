Hello! My names is Anthony and I am 23 years old. At first I was going to college to become a chemical engineer. I have always had a deep passion for science and engineering. I have always admired the unlimited but unknown potential that still lies in science, but what always bugged me in school was classes like calculus and physics were tough, but I was still ultimately learning something that was discovered in the 1600's and has been solved a countless number of times. When I thought ahead to grad school I knew I would be ultimately discovering new information in science. But realistically what my lab partners and I would be able to come up with would be a small drop in the bucket of what science is. I started to realize no matter how smart, fast, and efficient I was, I would never be able to compete with computers with a well-set-up program to do the research for us. 

When COVID-19 hit I chose not to complete my chemical engineering degree at UC San Diego because I was presented with the opportunity to pivot my education into a field where I knew I belonged, coding! I'm excited to explore the opportunities I will be presented with during my coding career and the contributions I will be able to leave behind for generations to come!
